### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my journey! ðŸ¤©
Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, MongoDB, PHP, MySQL, Docker, AWS are my attributes, still counting.

- I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Seattle.
- I worked as a Software Engineer at Bank of America, for about two and a half years, from Jun, 2019 to Dec, 2022.
- I also worked as a Software Developer Intern at IBM, India for about 5 months.

I love fast-paced environments where I can be creative, solve problems, and collaborate with others. I'm passionate about designing and developing innovative solutions to real-world problems, and have completed several academic projects to this end.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me on GitHub! ðŸ˜Š
